-- have a complex task that can contain multiple taskAssignments 
-- e.g. navigateToPos -> pickupItems -> plantTrees -> navigateToPos -> dropItems -> returnHome
-- keep track of completion etc. 
-- can ofc also be programmed directly as a single task on turtle but
-- this way we can be more creative and flexible with combining tasks

-- perhaps also add some conditions/events 
-- turtle 1 plantsTrees -> timer 5 minutes -> turtle 2 -> mineTrees
-- not bound to a certain turtle or anything

-- question is what shoud be managed by taskManager and what by complexTask
